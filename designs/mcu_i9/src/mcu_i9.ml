(* Colorlight i9 v7.2 (Lattice ECP5 LFE5U-45F) top level for the MCU:
   RV32I + Zicsr (CSRs, interrupts, mcycle/minstret), 64 KiB RAM, a
   50 MHz system clock from the 25 MHz oscillator through the ECP5 PLL
   (Pll; EXPERIMENT=no-pll runs from the 25 MHz pin directly), 115200
   baud through the ext board's DAPLink USB serial port, LED D2.

   Pins (designs/mcu_i9/colorlight_i9.lpf) follow wuxx/Colorlight-FPGA-Projects:
   clock P3, UART TX J17 / RX H18 (as on the i5 ext board), LED D2 on L2.
   The LED is driven active low, as on the other Colorlight modules.

   Bring-up aids (B-0014; docs/BRINGUP_I9.md):
   - the MCU is held in reset until the PLL reports lock (synchronised)
     and for about 21 ms after that (Mcu.Startup; EXPERIMENT=no-hold
     shortens the latter);
   - the single LED shows the state: slow blink = clock and bitstream run
     but the firmware has not started; steady on = firmware started (crt0
     sets LEDS bit 0); fast blink = the core halted (trap). *)
