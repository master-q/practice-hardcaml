/* Measurement hooks for riscv-tests' Dhrystone on the practice-hardcaml MCU.
   setStats(1) is called just before the timed loop, setStats(0) just after
   it; we record the CYCLE and INSTRET counters and print the difference in
   a fixed format that the testbench parses:

     dhrystone: runs=N cycles=C instret=I
     dhrystone: DMIPS/MHz=0.ddd

   DMIPS/MHz = runs * 1e6 / (cycles * 1757); in thousandths that is
   runs * 569152 / cycles (569152 = 1e9 / 1757), which fits in 32 bits
   for up to 7000 runs.

   (debug_printf, used for the verbose output, is defined empty in
   riscv-tests' dhrystone.c.) */
